## Running petclinic locally
Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 11 or newer):


```
git clone https://github.com/tinnapat/spring-petclinic-opentelemetry.git
cd spring-petclinic-opentelemetry
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

Tracing can be viewed via Jaeger UI which can be access via http://localhost:16686. 

The service name is `spring-petclinic`.
